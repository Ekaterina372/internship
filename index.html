    <p><b>It is a fact becoming more and more obvious that too little </b> <strong>study and effort to interpret their physical condition have been given to those <mark>unfortunates suffering from</mark> narcotic drug addiction</strong>.</p>

    <p><em>We have</em> neglected their disease in its origin and subsequent progress and formed our conception of its character from fully developed conditions and spectacular end-results. <i>We have seen some of them during or after our fruitless efforts at treatment</i>, their tortures and poor physical condition overcoming their resolutions, <s>until they plead for and attempted</s> to obtain more of their drug. We have seen others exhausted, starved, with locked-up elimination, toxic from self-made poisons of faulty metabolism, worn with the struggle of concealment and hopeless resistance, and for the time being more or less irresponsible beings, made so, not because of their addiction-disease itself, but because they were hopeless and discouraged and did not know which way to turn for relief.</p>
    
    <p>What literature has appeared on the subject has usually pictured them as weak-minded, deteriorated wretches, mental and moral derelicts, pandering to morbid sensuality; taking a drug to soothe them into supposed dream states and give them languorous delight; held by most of us in dislike and disgust, and regarded as so depraved that their rescue was impossible and they unworthy of its attempt.</p>
